#
# Application Architecture and Design Pattern

The application is designed and implemented following the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) pattern. This architectural choice facilitates the separation of business logic, data access, and user interface, thereby significantly enhancing the application's scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.

- **ASP.NET Web API (Service Layer):** The backend services of the application are realized through the ASP.NET Web API. This is where the business logic and data access functionalities are implemented, providing responses and data to clients. This layer directly interacts with the database and other backend systems, delivering responses to clients.

- **React Application (User Interface):** Responsible for the user interface and user interactions, the React application acts as the frontend. It communicates with the ASP.NET Web API to query and modify data through HTTP requests. The React application then presents the received data in a user-friendly and interactive interface.

#### This architecture enables the application to provide services through a well-defined API. The adoption of the SOA approach establishes distinct boundaries between various components, which in turn promotes streamlined development, ease of maintenance, and long-term success. The application's structure is designed to be flexible, adaptable to future development, and poised to cater to evolving needs.
#

The state is stored within the component's state property and updated using the setState function. This is suitable for simpler applications where state doesn't extend across many components.

- **External State Management Libraries:** For more complex applications, introducing external state management libraries such as Redux or MobX can be beneficial. These libraries offer centralized state management, where the application's state is stored and modified in a single location. This facilitates easier state management and tracking of state changes, particularly in larger applications.

- **State Design:** Designing states is crucial. Consider which components need to store state and which can remain stateless. The state should have a clear and easily traceable structure.

- **Component Interactions:** Planning and passing state between various components of the application requires careful consideration. State should only be stored where necessary, and the exchange of state between components should be strategically designed.

- **Immutability Principle:** Adhering to the principle of immutability is important when updating state. State should never be directly modified; instead, a new state should be created, and the setState function or appropriate functions in libraries should be used to update it.

#### Selecting and planning the appropriate state management approach facilitates the flow of necessary information among components, prevents state-related errors, and maintains the application's stability.
